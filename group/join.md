title: Joining the Lab
---

I am always looking for talented and motivated individuals with skills in synthetic organic and polymer chemistry to join the lab. Speculative applications are welcome. To apply, email a 2 page CV and 1 page research plan/motivation to <a href="mailto:seb@spain-lab.co.uk">Seb</a>.



## Current Vacancies

### PhD Studentship in Oxidation-Sensitive Materials

This studentship is linked to our current EPSRC-funded project in the development of oxidation-sensitive nanomaterials for treatment of immune diseases. The project will involve the synthesis of oxidation-sensitive hyperbranched polydendrons and the determination of their suitability as drug carriers for inflammatory diseases. During the project you will develop skills in small molecule organic synthesis, polymer synthesis using controlled radical polymerisation techniques, polymer and colloid analysis including gel permeation chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and small angle X-ray scattering, and cell based assays.

Suitable candidates will have a good undergraduate degree in chemistry (MChem 2:1 or above). Experience in organic or polymer synthesis is highly desirable but not essential. Due to the nature of this project, the ability to work in an interdisciplinary team is essential.

Three years funding is available for UK students including a tax-free stipend at RCUK rates (Â£14,553 p.a. in 2017/18) and tuition fees. The expected start date is Sept./Oct. 2018.
