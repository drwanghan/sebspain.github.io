**Project:** New embolic agents

**Funding:** [EPSRC CDT in Polymers, Soft Matter and Colloids](http://www.polymercentre.org.uk/centre-for-doctoral-training/) and [BTG](https://www.btgplc.com)

## Research

The focus of my research project is the development of a radiopaque in situ gelling material for use in therapeutic embolization.

## Biography

In 2015, I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a Masters degree in chemistry including industrial experience gained from a years placement at Biocompatibles, a BTG International group company. During the industrial placement, I worked as an innovation technician focusing on the development of radiopaque beads for transarterial embolization being involved with the project as it progressed from early stage research through development to preclinical trial manufacture. The opportunity also arose to extend the placement over summer, during which I worked to provide scientific support for a patent application. For my final year project I was based in the Jones research group at the University of Sheffield specialising in the area of asymmetric synthesis using chiral auxiliaries. The focus of the project was the development of a synthetic route for the preparation of a chiral compound designed to behave as a molecular mimic of an intermediate formed during the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid within the flagellum of bacteria. Thereby, behaving as a novel antibiotic for pathogenic bacteria.
