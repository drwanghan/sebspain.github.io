Assuming you could actually make a DrugPrinter, how instantly would it be able to produce enough drug for testing? Let's assume we want to make 10 mg of compound (enough for physicochemical analysis and basic screening) and it has a molar mass of 500 g/mol. 

10 x 10^-3 / 500 = 2 x 10^-5 moles

From Avagadro's number we can calculate the number of molecules

Molecules = 6.022 x 10^23 x 2 x 10^-5 = 1.2044 x 10^19 molecules

Assuming a synthesis rate of 1 molecule per second that comes out as 381.6 billion years to make 10 mg of material. Even at 1 molecule per nanosecond it'll take 381 years. By that point you lead will have changed.
