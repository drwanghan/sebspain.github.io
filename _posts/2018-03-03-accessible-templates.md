I've previously written about producing [graphics for publication](/2013/01/29/graphics-for-scientists-intro.html) but in that I neglected to discuss accessibility. I will probably add something that at a later date but, in the mean time, I have created a [github repository](https://github.com/sebspain/accessible_templates) for accessible templates.

For those who don't know how to use github (and don't wish to learn) direct links to specific templates are below:

[ChemDraw ACS template - colour blind safe palette](https://github.com/sebspain/accessible_templates/raw/master/ChemDraw/colour_blind_ACS.cds)

[ChemDraw Slide template - colour blind safe palette](https://github.com/sebspain/accessible_templates/raw/master/ChemDraw/colour_blind_slide.cds)

[Inkscape - colour blind safe palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebspain/accessible_templates/master/Inkscape/colour_blind_pallete.gpl)
