_This is part of a series of posts about producing publication quality graphics. [See here for the introduction and links to other parts](http://sebspain.co.uk/2013/01/29/graphics-for-scientists-intro.html)._


###Vector formats
*General Advantages*

- vector images are resolution free (no degradation on scaling)
- vector images can contain raster components, although these components will behave in the same way as raster images i.e. quality will degrade on scaling
- file sizes can be very small*

*General Disadvantages*

- complicated images (those with lots of detail) can be very large and slow for a computer to display

**Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)**
EPS is a well-established vector format and in my experience the most commonly accepted (and expected) by academic publishers. It's ubiquity is due to the format's age (it is based upon PostScript which appeared in 1982) but this also means it has some limitations in it's capabilities.

*Advantages*

- Well accepted by publishers
- Commonly available in graphics software

*Disadvantages*

- Limited support for transparency and gradient effects 
- Native support of EPS was removed from Windows from XP onwards and MS Office support ended with Office 2003. This makes it a difficult format to use for general document writing (unless you install extra software and use LaTeX)

**Portable Document Format (PDF)**
PDF

*Advantages*

- Well accepted by publishers
- Commonly available in graphics software

*Disadvantages*

- Limited support for transparency and gradient effects 
- Native support of EPS was removed from Windows from XP onwards and MS Office support ended with Office 2003





###Raster/bitmap formats
*General advantages*

- better for highly detailed images (i.e. 'photographs')
- more common/familiar

*General disadvantages*

- images can't be scaled without loss of quality
- file sizes tend to be large*
- care needs to be taken with compression

*File sizes are a bit more complicated than this.
