Recently [Kids can't use computers by Marc Scott](http://www.coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/) appeared on my Facebook feed. For those that haven't read (or don't wish to read) that rather long post it can be summarised as:

> Kids these days are considered to be computer experts by many of the older generation. Most aren't and can only use facebook/twitter/tumbler etc. This needs fixing or we're buggered.

This is an opinion that rang true for me as I am increasingly surprised by the lack of basic computing skills that the students (undergraduate and postgraduate) I encounter have.

According to my friend and former colleague [Dr Paco](https://twitter.com/Paco_bham) I can "see the Matrix". This isn't a reference to my taste in film but instead to me working with a text editor and a command line interface rather than pointing and clicking a mouse to do everything. This isn't a statement I can deny; I prefer typesetting in $\LaTeX$ to fighting Word's idiosyncracies, write personal notes and emails in Markdown, and this website is produced with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Lack of skills - e.g. excel equations, word sectioning, endnote etc

No Willingness to learn

No curiosity/"playing" with software
