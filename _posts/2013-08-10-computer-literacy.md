According to my friend and former colleague [Dr Paco](https://twitter.com/Paco_bham) I can "see the Matrix". This isn't a reference to my taste in film but instead to me working with a text editor and a command line interface rather than pointing and clicking a mouse to do everything. This isn't a statement I can deny; I prefer typesetting in $\LaTeX$ to fighting Word's idiosyncracies, write personal notes and emails in Markdown, and this website is produced with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
