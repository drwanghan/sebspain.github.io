Over at [Chemistry-Blog](http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2013/08/13/alleged-data-manipulation-in-nano-letters-and-acs-nano-from-the-pease-group/) there is an article about some alleged manipulation of images in a couple of papers. Having been sent some dodgy images in the past (a story I can't really put online but suffice to say they didn't make it to publication) I thought I'd share a very useful website - [FotoForensics](http://fotoforensics.com/). FotoForensics uses a technique called [Error Level Analysis](http://fotoforensics.com/tutorial-ela.php) that doesn't confirm image manipulation but accentuates/highlights areas in an image that may have been saved a different number of times to the rest of the image.

I thought I'd run the images posted in the Chemistry-Blog story through this analysis and see what came out, I'll leave the interpretation to the reader.

NB. I do not own copyright on these images but consider this "fair use".
