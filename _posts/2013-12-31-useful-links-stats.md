I'll update this post occasionally as and when I find good sites about basic stats.

[Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide by Alex Reinhart](http://www.refsmmat.com/statistics/index.html)

A rather excellent introduction to basic statistics by demonstrating the common misunderstandings and mistakes in scientific analyses.

[Lectures on Biostatistics by David Colquhoun](http://www.dcscience.net/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf)

DC's out-of-print book, slightly dated but the maths hasn't changed.

[OpenIntro Statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/)
