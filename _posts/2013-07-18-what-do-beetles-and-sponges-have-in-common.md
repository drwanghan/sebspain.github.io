For the last year my girlfriend has been working in Nairobi. Recently, I visited her and she informed me about a rather interesting insect known as the *Nairobi fly*, a beetle belonging to the genus [*Paederus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paederus), that is feared by Nairobians. At first glance this beetle appears dangerous, it has the classic [warning colouration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism) of red and black, yet it is unable to bite or sting a person. So why is it so fear-inducing? It turns out that the Nairobi fly has moved on from fighting with physical weapons instead preferring (bio)chemical warfare as a defensive strategy. 

###Pederin
Within the haemolympth (the insect equivalent of the bloodstream) there is a chemical called pederin. Pederin is a vesicant (in chemical warfare terms a *blister agent*) and results in a condition known as [Paederus dermatitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paederus_dermatitis). A quick [Google image search](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=paederus+dermititus) suggests this is quite unpleasant.

The vesicant activity of pederin is likely due to its potent inhibition of cell division ([mitosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis)).
