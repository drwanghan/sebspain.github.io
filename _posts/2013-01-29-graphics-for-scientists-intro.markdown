As [DeevyBee](https://twitter.com/deevybee) has [pointed out](http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/exciting-day-in-life-of-scientist.html) previously, these days academic publishers expect scientists to not only to produce the written content of a journal article but also to provide figures in a suitable format that they can use directly, usually to very specific technical guidelines (for an example see the [Wiley's guidelines for [*Angew. Chem.*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/\(ISSN\)1521-3773/homepage/2002_graphgest.html). Although I don't entirely agree with DeevyBee's position on this, part of science communication is the production of good quality graphics, the expectation by publishers that all scientists will be *au fait* with the technicalities of graphic design is absurb and throwing around jargon such as


> The colors for color pictures must be defined with the CMYK system (do not use the RGB color system, which is common in Windows).


and


> Final format for vector graphics (stick diagrams, etc.): Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) with bound fonts and the characters must be converted into outlines, **not** Postscript (PS). The "bounding boxes" must be of an appropriate size.


is pointless when abbreviations such as CMYK are completely alien to them. This is somewhat ironic considering that the [*Angew. Chem.* author guidelines also state](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/\(ISSN\)1521-3773/homepage/2002_guideline.html)


> Please be considerate to our many readers for whom English is a foreign language---use a simple, clear style and avoid jargon.


With this in mind a couple of years ago I gave a brief presentation on the basics of producing publication quality graphics to a couple of the research groups I work with. Having recently spent a lot time preparing graphics for publication, often having to either start from scratch or make do with poor quality sources, I thought I'd produce a document that students etc could refer to in future. Rather than keep it in house I thought I'd produce it as a series of posts on here. As and when I add sections I'll link to them from here.
