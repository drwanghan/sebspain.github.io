Our research is diverse and encompasses aspects of organic and polymer chemistries, materials science, pharmacy and biology. We have a strong focus on the development of new materials for biomedical purposes such as therapeutics and diagnostics but also work in areas such as protective coatings and cosmetics. Details of some of our current and previous research interests can be found below.

###DNA responsive materials

Materials that respond to an external stimulus (e.g. temperature, pH, redox) have been heavily investigated as triggers for activating drug delivery/release as they may take advantage of variations in local environment found in different tissues or disease sites and thus greater specificity in drug targeting. However, these stimuli and fundamentally "crude", as many many in vivo states may effect them resulting in a reduction in specificity.

We have demonstrated that by introducing carefully designed nucleic acid segments into synthetic materials that their structure may be manipulated by addition of an additional complementary DNA strand. Using these methods we can control size, morphology and ligand display in a "programmable" sequence-specific manner with far greater control over trigger than simple temperature or pH.

###Temperature selective cellular uptake

We have demonstrated that particles coated with a temperature responsive polymer can be used to selectively target cells based upon temperature. When particles are below the transition temperature the corona is hydrated shielding the particles and cells from one another. Above the transition temperature, dehydration of the corona results in increased cell interactions and subsequent uptake with an increase in cytotoxicty compared to free drug. We are now improving the synthesis of these materials in partnership with AstraZeneca.

###Polymer-Virus Hybrids

In partnership with PsiOxus Therapeutics we are currently developing new materials for the systemic delivery of viruses for gene and virotherapy.
