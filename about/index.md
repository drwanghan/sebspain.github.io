###Name: Seb Spain
###Occupation: Research Fellow (Chemistry)

I was born and raised in the Dursley area of Gloucestershire. A place that was once beautifully described as "A one horse town, where even the horse left due to boredom and the desire to get a life" and inspiration for the now infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dursley_family#The_Dursleys">Dursley Family</a>. I attended Rednock School where I was taught chemistry by <a href="http://www.chemlabs.bris.ac.uk/bios/Tim_Harrison.html">Tim Harrison</a> and Tim Reed who introduced me to what fun it can be. I then moved to the University of Durham where I read chemistry and graduated with an MChem in 2004. During my undergraduate project with <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/profile/?id=173">Neil Cameron</a> (working with <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/gibson/">Matt Gibson</a>, now at Warwick) I realised that polymer chemistry was for me (as predicted by Tim Reed several years earlier) and stayed in Durham to study for a PhD with Neil. In early 2008 I moved to the <a href="http://www.clinpharm.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Oxford</a>, where I spent two years as a postdoc working on the development of "stealth" viruses and immunomodulatory polymers. In 2010 I moved to my current position in Nottingham where I am working for <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pharmacy/people/cameron.alexander">Cameron Alexander</a> on the development of DNA-polymer hybrids for drug-delivery.



When not in the lab I split my time between geeky hobbies (I'm a linux geek in training), graphic design (see my <a title="Gallery" href="http://sebspain.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a> for examples) and music (our one time Pharmacy band may be making a return).



<strong>About this site</strong>



This is basically an extension of my work website but as I have control over the server I'm got the freedom to use PHP/MySQL and make a slightly more modern website. Additionally, it'll be updated more regularly with research news and papers I found interesting as well as other general commentary of science and politics.
