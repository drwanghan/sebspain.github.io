### Name: Seb Spain
### Occupation: Research Fellow (Chemistry) 
I was born and raised in the Dursley area of Gloucestershire. A place that was once beautifully described as "A one horse town, where even the horse left due to boredom and the desire to get a life" and inspiration for the now infamous [Dursley Family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dursley_family#The_Dursleys). I attended Rednock School where I was taught chemistry by [Tim Harrison](http://www.chemlabs.bris.ac.uk/bios/Tim_Harrison.html) and Tim Reed who introduced me to what fun it can be. I then moved to the University of Durham where I read chemistry and graduated with an MChem in 2004. During my undergraduate project with [Neil Cameron](http://www.dur.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/profile/?id=173) (working with [Matt Gibson](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/gibson/),
now at Warwick) I realised that polymer chemistry was for me (as predicted by Tim Reed several years earlier) and stayed in Durham to study for a PhD with Neil. In early 2008 I moved to the [Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Oxford](http://www.clinpharm.ox.ac.uk/), where I spent two years as a postdoc working on the development of "stealth" viruses and immunomodulatory polymers. In 2010 I moved to my current position in Nottingham where I am working for [Cameron Alexander](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pharmacy/people/cameron.alexander) on the development of DNA-polymer hybrids for drug-delivery. When not in the lab I split my time between geeky hobbies (I'm a linux geek in training), graphic design (see my [gallery](http://sebspain.co.uk/gallery/ "Gallery") for examples) and music (our one time Pharmacy band may be making a return). 

###About this site
Originally this was supposed to an extension of my work website where I could use "modern" web technologies like PHP/MySQL but having grown tired of wordpress updates etc I've moved to the reliable Web 1.0 of a static website (generated with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), I'm *not* a luddite!)

In terms of content, I'm not a prolific blogger but I do intend on trying to keep this up-to-date with research news as well as other things I've found interesting.

###Comments Policy
One reason this site is here is to provoke discussion of the topics contained within consequently posting of comments relevant to posts is positively encouraged. As the content of posts can, occasionally, feature foul and abusive language it would be hypocritical of me to stop you using it too. Feel free but try and keep an air of imagination and wit about it. As some of the topics of discussion may be quite controversial please do not resort to *ad hom* and libellous attacks 
and/or trolling; the latter will earn a swift banning/IP block. Also, please cite references where
appropriate, whale.to is not a reference. To minimise the risk of legal proceedings and keep the content relevant I reserve the right to delete/edit posts where appropriate. In the case of edits, their nature will be clearly displayed at the bottom of the comment, posts will only be deleted if they cannot be edited to a more applicable content. 

The comment facility provided by [Disqus](http://disqus.com) and has additional spam-filtering by [askimet](https://akismet.com/). Occasionally a non-spam post will be caught and I'll have to release it from moderation so there may be a delay.
