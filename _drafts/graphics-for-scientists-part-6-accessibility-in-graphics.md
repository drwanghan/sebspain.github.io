In this post I am going to collate a few ways on how you can make graphics more accessible.




## Colour blindness

Colour blindness or, more correctly, colour vision deficiency (CVD) is the decreased ability to distinguish between colours. CVD is usually caused by a genetic defect that results in one (or more) of the light receptor cells in the retina being absent or functioning incorrectly.

The effects of different types of common CVD are simulated in the plots below.

The most common forms of CVD are red-green colour blindness where they cannot easily distinguish between reds and greens.
Putting aside the need for accessibility, there is another reason to make your graphics CVD safe - 8% of Northern European males are red-green colour blind and they are still the predominant population in science.

At that prevalence, we can determine the probability of a member of a smaller population having


if your professors and reviewers cannot understand your figures then your marks (or paper/grant submissions) will pay the price.
