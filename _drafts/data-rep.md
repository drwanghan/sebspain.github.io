_This is part of a series of posts about producing publication quality graphics. [See here for the introduction and links to other parts](http://sebspain.co.uk/graphics/graphics-for-scientists-intro/)._

The purpose of a figure is to represent a concept or data in a way that is easy to understand. If a figure does not aid understanding and clarity it has no place in a journal article. Consider the two images below. 

Both are representations of the biological process endocytosis but they are drawn in very different styles. The left image is, for want of a better word, very "arty" with a detailed textures and shading. Conversely, the right hand image is very simple with minimal shading or texture. Despite this is manages to summarise the 3 major forms of endocytosis in a clear manner whereas the left hand image manages only 1.

There's an [excellent article in PLoS Comp. Biol](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833) that covers some of this.
