This week is the [Electronic Frontier Foundation's](http://www.eff.org) [Copyright Week](https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek). 

This week is also the first time I've had a [press release](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2014/Pages/molecularnanospies.aspx) about a [paper](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/nr/c3nr04952c#divAbstract). 

- big supporter of OA and copyleft (see below)
- press didn't completely meet requirements of license despite being told
- churnalism (with links) didn't even acknowledge the CC-BY basics
