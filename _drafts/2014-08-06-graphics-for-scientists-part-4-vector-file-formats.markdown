_This is part of a series of posts about producing publication quality graphics. [See here for the introduction and links to other parts](http://sebspain.co.uk/graphics/graphics-for-scientists-intro/)._

In part [three](/2014/08/04/graphics-for-scientists-part-3-raster-file-formats.html) I went through the major raster image formats. Here I'll run through the most common vector ones and some advantages/disadvantages.

###Vector Formats

####EPS (.eps)
Encapsulated PostScript has been a standard "publication/print quality" vector format for many years but it is not well known outside of professional publishing. The EPS format is now very old (it a derivative of PostScript, released in 1982) so is not very advanced but still maintains strong support from publishers.

#####Advantages

- widely accepted industry standard

#####Disadvantages

- poor software support*
- no support for layers
- no support for transparency

####PDF (.pdf)
You'll be familiar with Portable Document Format (PDF) particularly for written documents but PDF is also a very good vector format.

#####Disadvantages



####SVG (.svg)
