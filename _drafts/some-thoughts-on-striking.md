...from a reluctant striker!

Despite being a member of the University and College Union, I never thought I'd strike.
Now I find myself waiting for a train home after a morning on the picket line followed by an excellent student-led march and rally for [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/)* on the ninth day of the ongoing UCU industrial action.
The overall reasons behind the dispute and dubiousness of calculations etc. have been covered in detailed elsewhere.
Instead, here is a personal perspective of how I ended up here and what I have learned along the way.

## How did I get here?

As noted above, I am a reluctant striker.
I appreciate the power that collective action can have, but having grown up with most notable strikes being relatively unsuccessful, and mass protests, such as those seen before the 2003 invasion of Iraq or against student fee increases in 2001, resulting in no change in policy I thought it's power was dwindling.
Consequently, my decision to join the UCU was more about providing security at a group or individual - such as contributing to and, if need be, receiving legal support for constructive dismissal - than large scale industrial action.

In previous strikes, where I felt less strongly about the cause or felt strikes were not the best course of action, I worked from home or took annual leave (I won't cross a picket).
When we had a departmental UCU meeting the week before these strikes began, I was still undecided as to what to do.
In the end, my decision to strike was not swayed by anything in particular.
The extent of the proposed changes to the pension scheme was an important factor, but that the previous changes to the scheme (in 2011 and 2015) were supposed to have solved the sustainability problem and so the proposed
changes would not be the end.
If these changes had gone ahead unchallenged, then in the ten years I been in the scheme I would have gone from a guaranteed final salary pension to a defined contribution in a stock market crap shoot that I have no control over. The lack of negotiation of UUK was also a factor. If they wanted to play hardball so would I. However, probably the most significant factor was my partner as she will likely be the main beneficiary of my pension and was happy to support me if I chose to strike.

## What has striking taught me?

### There are brilliant colleagues (and students) across the University

I've not been on the picket everyday (my train costs Â£13.70 return, which adds up if you aren't getting paid) but when I have been, I've met some great people from a broad cross section of the University.
Many of them will be much less affected by the proposed changes than me but they are fighting with us because they believe it is right.

Student groups have been equally brilliant, providing vocal support for staff on the pickets and in rallies. Students have also been great on an individual level. Despite me missing lectures and tutorials due to the action, I have not yet had any animosity towards me, either directly or indirectly, from students. Conversely, I have had plenty of supportive comments.

### I miss doing my job

I'll happily complain as


\* Before someone asks. Yes, there is an [International Men's Day](http://www.internationalmensday.com/), it's on November 19th. Get the fuck over it.
