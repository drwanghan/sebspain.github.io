...from a reluctant striker!

Despite being a member of the University and College Union, I never thought I'd strike.
Now I find myself waiting for a train home after a morning on the picket line followed by an excellent student-led march and rally for [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/)* on the ninth day of the ongoing UCU industrial action.
The overall reasons behind the dispute and dubiousness of calculations etc. have been covered in detail elsewhere.
Instead, here is a personal perspective of how I ended up here and what I have learned along the way.

## How did I get here?

As noted above, I am a reluctant striker.
I appreciate the power that collective action can have, but having grown up with most notable strikes being relatively unsuccessful, and mass protests, such as those seen before the 2003 invasion of Iraq or against student fee increases in 2011, resulting in no change in policy I thought its power was dwindling.
Consequently, my decision to join the UCU was more about providing security at a group or individual level - such as contributing to and, if need be, receiving legal support - than large scale industrial action.

In previous strikes, where I felt less strongly about the cause or felt strikes were not the best course of action, I worked from home or took annual leave (I won't cross a picket).
When we had a departmental UCU meeting the week before these strikes began I was still undecided as to what to do.
In the end, my decision to strike was not swayed by anything in particular.
The extent of the proposed changes to the pension scheme was an important factor, but that the previous changes to the scheme (in 2011 and 2015) were supposed to have solved the sustainability problem and so the proposed changes would probably not be the last was a bigger issue.
If these changes had gone ahead unchallenged, then in the ten years I been in the scheme I would have gone from a guaranteed final salary pension to a defined contribution in a stock market crap shoot that I have no control over.
The lack of negotiation of UUK was also a factor; if they wanted to play hardball then so would I.
However, probably the most significant factor was my partner as she will likely be the main beneficiary of my pension and was happy to support me if I chose to strike.

## What has striking taught me?

### There are brilliant colleagues (and students) across the University

I've not been on the picket everyday (my train costs Â£13.70 return, which adds up if you aren't getting paid) but when I have been, I've met some great people from a broad cross section of the University.
Many of them will be much less affected by the proposed changes than me but they are fighting with us because they believe it is right.
Even in the cold and snow there's been good humour, singing and dancing (arguably to keep warm).

Student groups have been equally brilliant, providing vocal support for staff on the pickets and in rallies.
I may not agree with all their politics (a lot of Marxists!) but I appreciate their support and solidarity, and hope to be able to repay the favour one day.
Students have also been great on an individual level.
Despite me missing lectures and tutorials due to the action, I have not yet had any animosity towards me, either directly or indirectly, from students.
Conversely, I have had plenty of supportive comments.

### I miss doing my job

The high pressure and workload of academia are [well known](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/work-life-balance-survey-2018-long-hours-take-their-toll-academics) and my colleagues and I will happily have a bitch about it in the pub on a Friday evening.
However, I still couldn't imagine doing anything else and, after an initial period of relaxation, it has been really hard not to do the work I enjoy.

I miss my tutees and helping them with the parts of the course they are struggling with or providing some additional context to some of the more abstract concepts.

I miss giving my lectures and workshops.
Although it can be disheartening looking at a room of blank faces (seriously, even when you enjoy a lecture you manage to looked bored, its an expressive skill!), it's great to see the looks on your faces when something clicks into place.

I *really* miss my research group.
They're a wonderful bunch of intelligent young people who frustrate the hell out of me at times but they we get to share science together.
They get to tell me their exciting new results and I get to help them with what to do next.
However, based on the emails I have received (I've been monitoring in case of emergencies) they only need me to sign forms.

When [UCU announced](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9392/Universities-face-14-days-of-strikes-during-exams-if-pension-dispute-not-resolved) that another 14 days of strikes are a possibility the financial were a concern, but not being at work is a bigger one.


\* Before someone asks. Yes, there is an [International Men's Day](http://www.internationalmensday.com/), it's on November 19th. Get the fuck over it.
