In [my last post](/2014/08/11/graphics-for-scientists-part-5-software.html) I introduced two golden rules for making publication quality graphics.

1. Don't use Excel
2. Don't use Powerpoint

If you know me, you'll probably know I have a near pathological hatred of Microsoft Word, but I reluctantly use it for writing papers with collaborators who don't use $\LaTeX$. However, I still occasionally use Excel and Powerpoint out of choice, so why am I so against them for creating graphics?
Basically it comes down to having the right tool for the job.
You *can* use Powerpoint for making figures and, with some workarounds, you [can produce something of near publication quality](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827745). 
Similarly, you can cut a plank of wood with a chisel, but using a saw is going to be quicker, easier, and give a better result. Here are some more specific reasons:

####Excel

The statistical analyses in Excel are known to be full of errors. There have been multiple papers written on the subject [1], and yet many of them still haven't been fixed by Microsoft.
Basically, Excel is pretty crap at data analysis so you may as well use something else.

The default graphs are *ugly* and often represent data badly.
