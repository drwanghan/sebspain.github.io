Since Sharpless et al. first described the "click" chemistry philosophy in 2001 the number of reports of its use has grown exponentially.

For those not familiar with the click philosophy the original paper stated:

> The reaction must be modular, wide in scope, give very high yields, generate only inoffensive byproducts that can be removed by nonchromatographic methods, and be *stereospecific* (but not necessarily enantioselective). The required process characteristics include *simple reaction conditions* (ideally, the process should be insensitive to oxygen and water), *readily available starting materials and reagents*, the use of *no solvent or a solvent that is benign* (such as water) *or easily removed*, and *simple product isolation*. Purification - if required - must be by nonchromatographic methods, such as crystallization or distillation, and the product must be stable under physiological conditions.

Which roughly boils down to:

* simple to do
* cheap materials
* water as solvent
* little or no purification

The classic click reaction is the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reported by Sharpless et al. and Meldal et al. a year later (ADD REFS). This an modification of Huisgen's [1,3]-dipolar cycloaddition that proceeded regioselectively and at ambient temperature.
